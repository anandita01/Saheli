##Problem Statement:
Women’s safety has been an ongoing issue ever since the first woman appeared on the face of the earth. However due to the unavailability of proper safety resources, women empowerment education, quick help and lack of awareness it becomes very difficult for the victim to cope up with the sudden accidents like sexual harassment, domestic violence .Women should never feel that they are at fault for someone else’s actions. This is why it is so important that all women are offered training in ways to protect themselves and ensure their safety.

##Proposed solution:
This app 'Saheli' aims at ensuring proper safety of women by providing all the safety features that a woman would need at the time of danger.
It is like a companion that stays there to help empower women and protect them. Our app provides the user with the following features:
   1. With the click of one button the victim can call their family to help them.
   2. Share their live locations and sos via sms to the trusted contacts like their family and friends
   3. Our app serves as a resource for the users to learn about various government schemes regarding women welfare and safety.
   4. Users get the access to  know the locations of nearby police stations, hospitals, bus stands, pharmacies to ask for help at the time of vulnerability.
